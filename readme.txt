This is an implementation of Kernel Smoothing Methods.

The idea is to smooth a Kernel created from data in order to recreate the original curve producing the data.

Methods shown are first K-NN kernel with Nadaraya-Watson kernel weighted average, next the Tri-cube kernel and lastly the same Tri-cube Kernel using Linear Regression instead of the kernel weighted average.
Other kernels mentioned in the chapter are also implemented within the code ready to be run.



Methods implemented from Hastie Elements of Statistical Learning; Chapter 6.
